# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm
 This repository contains my coursework, lab exercises, and implementations for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab. It showcases fundamental and advanced concepts through clean, organized, and well-commented code.

 The goal of this repo is to strengthen my understanding of core DSA topics while building a strong foundation for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

What’s Inside

🧩 Data Structure Implementations
Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps, and more.

⚙️ Algorithmic Exercises
Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Graph Traversals, etc.

🧪 Lab Tasks & Assignments
Weekly DSA lab solutions and experiments.

📂 Modular & Well-Structured Code
Each topic is separated into folders for easy navigation.
